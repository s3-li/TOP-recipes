        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 bottle of British Ale</li>
                <li>1 tsp pumpkin pie spice</li>
                <li>1/3 cup of brown sugar/li>
                <li>2 egg yolks</li>
                <li>2.5 tbsp of unsalted butter</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Start by pouring the ale into a saucepan. To keep it from ‘exciting’ (foaming up), angle the saucepan and gently pour the ale down the side into the pan.</li>
                <li>Stir in the 1 tsp of spices.</li>
                <li>Gently heat until it comes to a boil, then lower the heat straight away and let simmer for a few minutes.</li>
                <li>In these few minutes, whisk together the yolks and sugar.</li>
                <li>Remove from the heat, let sit for a few minutes to bring the heat down, then add in the yolks and sugar to the ale.</li>
                <li>Whisk until the sugar has dissolved and let simmer for 3-5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in the butter until fully mixed in.</li>
                <li>With a hand blender, froth the ale until foam forms. Let sit to cool.</li>
                <li>Using a spoon, hold back the froth as you pour the butterbeer into the beer stein. Leave about an inch of room on the top, spoon on the froth and serve.</li>
