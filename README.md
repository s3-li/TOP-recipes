# Odin Recipes
My first ever project assignment from The Odin Project. I will create a recipe website with 4 pages using HTML.

# What I learnt
* Setting up the boilerplate for a webpage including the head and body
* How to add text to a webpage.
* How to structure elements using tags including links, headers, images, and lists.
